I used to get frustrated having to go to the Extensions page every time I needed to enable or disable an extension. It was time-consuming and annoying. That’s why I built this extension—to make managing my browser extensions easier and faster.

## What is it?

This extension is a tool I created to make managing Chrome extensions a lot easier. If you're tired of going to the Extensions page just to toggle a few extensions, this is for you. With this extension, you can control your extensions directly from your toolbar.

You can enable or disable extensions, organize them into modes, and switch between them quickly. It saves time and makes managing extensions feel easier and faster.

## Features:

- **Toggle Extensions On/Off**: Turn extensions on or off without opening the Extensions page.
- **Create Modes**: Group extensions by task, project, or anything else, and activate them with one click.
